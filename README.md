### Project Description

First analysis project using Tableau made during Data Analysis Ironhack Bootcamp.
For this analysis I chose a dataset with information about the frequency of alcohol consumption between high school students in Portugal.

### Questions & Hypotheses

Does the daily alcohol consumption affect student's performance? Does family and social relations has any effect on the frequency of alcohol consumption? Does the frequency of daily alcohol consumption has any relation with gender? 

### Dataset

For this project I used a part of the kaggle.com dataset that can be found in the following addres:
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption

The data used is the one obtained in a survey with students of portuguese language courses. This chose was made based on the following question: Does daily alcohol consumption affect performance even in mother language course?

### Workflow

To organize the workflow and create a schedule the tool used was Trello.com. 

The first step after downloading the data was analysing and cleaning the data using jupyter notebook and Pandas. 
Some of the column names wasn't descriptive enough and needed a guide to be "translated". For this reason most of the columns were renamed as well some of the values. Most of the information was numerical and some of them were replaced by a descreptive value. 
This decision was based on the idea of providing more self descreptive data, unfortunately this made the analysis and the graph creation more challenging, since just a small portion of the data was numerical. 
Despite that I decided to continue with the descriptive data.

After Analysing the data, the most important charts were used to build a Tableau story. 

### Analysis

After analysing the data and the charts, were possible to achieve some conclusion based on the dataset provided. 
Is possible to notice that the most of the students has higher frequency of alcohol consumption during the weekend, even though the daily consumption in low frequency is higher. 

Students with higher average age also has higher daily alcohol consumption frequency and girls declare to consume alcohol in lower frequency than boys. 

Although the frequency of alcohol consumption seams not to influence on failures and absences, is possible to notice the decrease of the grades between students that has daily high or very high consumption.
